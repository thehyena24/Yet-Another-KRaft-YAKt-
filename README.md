# Yet Another KRaft (YaKt)

This project is a simple demo of the working of the KRaft protocol. 
<br></br>

KRaft is a event based, distributed metadata management system that was written to replace Zookeeper in the ecosystem of Kafka. It uses Raft as an underlying consensus algorithm to do log replication and manage consistency of state.

<br></br>
This project utilized pysyncobj, an open-source implementation of Raft consensus algorithm, to implement the KRaft nodes.
